### Installations and Requirments

This project requires that you have matplotlib installed.

### Project Motivation

This is a python package that offers efficient and simple tools to work with Gaussian
and Binomial distributions. With this package a user can create a
distribution from a txt file, calculate, plot and combine 
distributions, and report results.


### File Descriptions

- Generaldistribution.py: a class that initializes a distribution and can read a text file
and save it as the relevant dataset.
- Gaussiandistribution.py: a class that inherits the read data function from the general distribution, 
and then contains various gaussian distribution methods like calculating the mean, standard deviation,
plotting the distribution, and adding distributions together.
- Binomialdistribution.py: a class that inherits the read data function from the
general distribution, and then contains various binomial distribution methods like calculating
the probability of a specific outcome, and plotting the probabilities of all possible outcomes.
- init.py: initializes the binomial and gaussian classes.
- numbers.txt: a sample dataset to test the gaussian distribution classes.
- numbers_binomial.txt: a sample data-set to test the binomial distribution classes. 
- test.py: unit tests to test if the classes are working as expected.
